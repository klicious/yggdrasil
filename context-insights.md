### Structured Metadata System
```yaml
# Enforced front-matter contract
title: "Document Title"
owners: ["team@company.com"]
last_updated: "2025-07-19"
tags: ["domain", "type", "topic"]
version: "1.0"
domain: "processes"  # strategy|people|governance|processes|templates|projects
status: "active"     # active|draft|archived
approval_required: false  # true for policy changes
```

### Content Lifecycle Management

- **Unified Search**: Vector knowledge base indexes both repositories with collection prefixes
- **Synchronization Workflows**: Automated validation of cross-repository references

### Knowledge Base Architecture
```python
# Collection structure for unified search
collections = [
    "yggdrasil-strategy",    # Mission, vision, values
    "yggdrasil-people",      # Team information and roles
    "yggdrasil-governance",  # Policies and standards
    "yggdrasil-processes",   # SOPs and workflows
    "yggdrasil-templates",   # Document templates
    "yggdrasil-projects",    # Project summaries
    "runebook-*"             # Technical documentation collections
]
```

## Operational Excellence Patterns

### Automation-First Approach
- **Minimal Manual Overhead**: Automated validation, deployment, and maintenance
