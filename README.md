# yggdrasil
Yggdrasil is the living handbook of our team. It holds mission, member bios, policies, SOPs, and high-level project dashboards that link back to Runebook. Markdown + YAML front-matter are linted and auto-published as an internal site and indexed into the KB, providing the single source for all non-code knowledge.
